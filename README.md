# KuiToi-Server

## About
**_[Status: Beta]_** \
BeamingDrive Multiplayer (BeamMP) server compatible with BeamMP clients.

Why did I decide to write my own kernel from scratch?\
I didn't like writing plugins in Lua after using Python; it was very inconvenient, there were always some nuances, which ultimately led me to create KuiToi!
